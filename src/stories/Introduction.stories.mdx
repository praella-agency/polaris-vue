# Welcome to Polaris Vue

Polaris Vue provides Shopify's Polaris Component Library support for VueJS framework.

That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

Browse example stories now by navigating to them in the sidebar.
View their code in the `src/stories` directory to learn how they work.
We recommend building UIs with a [**component-driven**](https://componentdriven.org) process starting with atomic components and ending with pages.
